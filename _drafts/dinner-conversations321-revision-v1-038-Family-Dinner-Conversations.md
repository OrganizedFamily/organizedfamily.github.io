### Background

Years ago Amy was thanking her parents for all that they taught her about values, how to be a good person, and so much more. Her parents told her that what they did for her won&#8217;t be enough for her kids today. More needs to be done to teach them and reinforce and prepare them for today&#8217;s world. Amy realized they could make better use of their time together at dinner every day, having better quality conversations. She compiled a list of questions to pick each night during dinner to spark conversations with the kids. Amy put them into categories like friends, values, drugs, etc. so they could cover just about any topic the kids deal with today.

If this is something you want to implement with your family, you can either type up the questions, cut them into strips of paper and put them in a jar to pull out each day and discuss, or you could put them on a note card, in categories in a little box and pull them out that way. Mitchell use the questions glued onto note cards, so they can write the responses from the kids on the note card and refer to them again later. They also let their kids take turns choosing the card from a category they want to talk about.

Dave listened to a podcast recently and learned about something called the [Ungame](http://www.ungame.com/). A lady named Rhea Zakich developed nodules on her vocal chords, so her doctor recommended she not talk for a few months to give them time to heal. During this time, she took a notebook around with her and wrote down questions she wanted to ask her family, and she realized how poorly her family communicated. So they started spending time answering the questions she had written in her notebook when they were together. This really improved their family relationships.

### What are dinner conversations?

Dinner conversations can be started by asking questions that cover a wide variety of topics that families can discuss while sitting around the dinner table.

### Why have dinner conversations?

  1. To get to know your family members better
  2. To teach values to your kids
  3. To discuss situations that children may one day find themselves in, so they have a plan now of how to act later when they are really in that situation.

### Rules

  1. Provide a safe environment where all answers are accepted and not mocked.
  2. Only one person talks at a time.
  3. Everyone is part of the same conversation.
  4. Add whatever rules you feel your family needs to keep it a positive and engaging tradition for everyone.
