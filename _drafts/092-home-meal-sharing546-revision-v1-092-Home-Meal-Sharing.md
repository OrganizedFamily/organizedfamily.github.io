One of the hardest things about preparing meals is coming up with an idea. There are times when even that doesn&#8217;t help because nothing sounds appealing. Yet there is a way around that: Sharing meals with others.

A couple of years ago our family got together with some other families in the neighborhood and began sharing meal ideas and making them together. In this weeks episode, we discuss how to organize a meal sharing group, some of the motivations behind starting one and what important questions you need to address before getting together in a meal sharing group.

You can get the full show notes by subscribing to our newsletter at <http://www.organizedfamily.co/>. Not only will you get the show notes, but you will also get access to tools that can help you organize trips, have more meaningful conversations at the dinner table and some sample chore charts you can use in your home.
