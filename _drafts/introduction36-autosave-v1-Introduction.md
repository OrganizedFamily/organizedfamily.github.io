A brief introduction to the Mitchells, the hosts of the Organized Family podcast.

### Dave

  * grew up as a military dependent
  * works as a software developer and as a software development manager
  * active in boy scouts and church, a member of the library board in their city
  * Enjoys indoor activities and a couple sports (soccer and basketball)

### Amy

  * Grew up in the same town all her life
  * Stay at home mom
  * On school community council
  * Runs an sports program for women in our area
  * Enjoys outdoor activities

### Us

  * We met in college, married for almost 20 years. 
  * Five children. Red, Blue, Green, Yellow and Purple (That&#8217;s episode 5)
  * We&#8217;re both organized

## Why did we start the podcast?

  * People kept asking how we do it
  * Visitors impressed or ask questions when they come over 
  * Get request to teach classes on organization
  * Reach a broader audience with some of our ideas

## Goal for podcast

  * Share what we know
  * It&#8217;s not just moms that need to be involved, but dads too. You cannot be successful as a couple or a family unless both parents are involved. You can have different focus&#8217; but you are a team

## Why do we think organization is important?

  * Saves time
  * Helps reduce tension
  * Provides for a place where people can be more creative and productive

## All episodes will be in one of four categories

  * Personal
  * Kids
  * Home
  * Finances

Frequency: Once a week

Length: We&#8217;re shooting for about 20 minutes

The quote &#8220;Organization saves time&#8221; came from the movie [&#8220;The Most Wonderful Time of the Year&#8221;](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1327788/). The name of the book about tidying up is [&#8220;The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing&#8221;](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1607747308/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1607747308&linkCode=as2&tag=digitalbias-20)
