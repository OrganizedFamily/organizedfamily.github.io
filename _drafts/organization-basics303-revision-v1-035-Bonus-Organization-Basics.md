## Be consistent

Consistently put things where they belong, like always putting your keys in the same place.

Consistently do things the same time each week, like when you sit down to plan out your week.

Consistently do things at the same time each day, like exercising.

Consistency creates habits.

If you want to get rid of bad habits, replace it with a new, more desirable habit.

A [Habit Journal](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1547291031/the-habit-journal-track-your-habits-and-achieve-yo) lists the habit you want to do for four weeks and helps you track it.

Use systems that are easy to keep up and maintain consistently.

## Be deliberate

Decide what you want your life to look like, and deliberately create that life.

Looking back, the times that you were healthiest were probably the times that you made the most effort to eat healthily and exercise. When you were most on top of your finances, it was when you deliberately took the time to enter all the spending into your budget.

When you are deliberate, you will be more organized.

## Label things

Dave and Amy use a [labeler](http://www.brother-usa.com/Labeling_Solutions/ModelDetail/7/PT45M/Overview) to quickly print out any label they want. It makes everything look sharp and easy to read when trying to find them.

If you don&#8217;t have a label maker, you can just write your own labels.

If you have kids who can&#8217;t read yet, you can label their items with pictures. Mitchells used to find pictures from magazines of Polly Pockets, Legos, My Little Ponies, etc. and tape them on to the front of the drawer that those specific toys belonged in.

You can label categories of a medicine cabinet with categories like painkillers, cold and cough syrups, eye or ear infection drops&#8230;

Labeling helps everyone in the house support your organizing system.
