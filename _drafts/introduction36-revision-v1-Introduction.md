# Show Notes for Episode 000

## Introductions

A brief introduction to the Mitchells, the hosts of the Organized Family podcast.

### Dave

  * Grew up as a military dependent
  * Works as a software developer and as a software development manager
  * Active in Boy Scouts and church, a member of the library board in our city
  * Enjoys indoor activities and a couple of sports (soccer and basketball)

### Amy

  * Grew up in the same town all my life
  * Stay at home mom
  * On school community council
  * Runs a sports program for women in our area
  * Enjoys coaching and playing sports
  * Also enjoys photography, hiking, yard work and being outdoors

### Us

  * We met in college, married for almost 20 years. 
  * Five children. Red, Blue, Green, Yellow and Purple (That&#8217;s episode 5)
  * We have very different backgrounds and hobbies, but weâ€™re both organized

## Why did we start the podcast?

  * People kept asking how we do it
  * Visitors impressed or ask questions when they come over 
  * Get request to teach classes on organization
  * Reach a broader audience with some of our ideas

## Goal for podcast

  * Share what we know
  * It&#8217;s not just moms that need to be involved, but dads too. You cannot be successful as a couple or a family unless both parents are involved. You can have different focus&#8217; but you are a team
  * Podcast Angle: to point out that all members of family contribute to being organized, not just the mom

## Why do we think organization is important?

  * Saves time
  * Helps reduce tension and promote harmony
  * Provides for a place where people can be more creative and productive

## All episodes will be in one of four categories

  * Personal organization
  * Kids organization
  * Home organization
  * Finance organization

Frequency: Once a week

Length: We&#8217;re shooting for about 20 minute long podcasts

The quote &#8220;Organization saves time&#8221; came from the movie [&#8220;The Most Wonderful Time of the Year&#8221;](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1327788/).  
The name of the book about tidying up is [&#8220;The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing&#8221;](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1607747308/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1607747308&linkCode=as2&tag=digitalbias-20)
