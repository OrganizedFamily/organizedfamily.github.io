Getting ready to launch this project has been something of a staggered process.

Start. Stop. Start. Stop.

That&#8217;s what it has felt like the last couple months as we have been mulling over the topic of what it means to be an organized family. We started the blog, &#8220;The Organized Family&#8221; over at TheOrganizedFamily.org, but a number of people we talked to told us that our domain name stunk and that there were better names out there, we decided to move. We&#8217;d only been there a short time and had not had any traffic to speak of. So, here we are.

Another thing we discovered is that we don&#8217;t do posting/writing really well. We find it difficult to keep up on it. But sitting down to talk? That we can do.

The last thing we discovered is that Amy has a lot of the ideas or thoughts, but that she rarely has the inclination to write it all down while I (Dave) do. So, we thought, &#8220;Why not do a podcast?&#8221;

With a podcast, we can talk about the subject and then Dave can go back and take the main points out of it and write up a post. We&#8217;d publish the podcast episode along with the show notes and that would be the new version of the blog.

So, that&#8217;s what we are going to be doing going forward. New site. New format. Some of the good old content.

Then we started looking at the <a href="http://www.eofire.com/fpc" target="_blank">Free Podcast Course</a> and discovered we needed to define who our avatar was.

So, today we went through that exercise. Good stuff.

With that done, we still have a number of things to complete before launching the podcast, namely:

  1. Record at least three, if not more, episodes of the podcast
  2. Create/contract a podcast logo
  3. Finish configuring the site. That includes: 
      1. SEO plugins
      2. Banner image
      3. Podcast configuration
  4. Find people to promote the site/link back to us
