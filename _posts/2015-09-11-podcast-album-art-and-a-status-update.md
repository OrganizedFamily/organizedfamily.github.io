So here we are, another week has gone by and it&#8217;s time for us to give another status update for the Organized Family Podcast.

This week we recorded another three episodes for the podcast. We still need to go through and edit them, clean them up little bit and get them ready for publishing, but we&#8217;re pleased with the cadence that we&#8217;ve hit with them as well as the topics. We have some really interesting topics and feel everybody will be benefited by at least one thing in each episode.

We also want to get a little bit ahead of ourselves simply because life happens and we want to be prepared for it. If you have been following <a href="https://www.facebook.com/amy.c.mitchell.77>Amy on Facebook</a>, you would know that I (Dave) [broke my toe](https://www.facebook.com/amy.c.mitchell.77/posts/10206070543055123) this week while getting ready for a neighborhood breakfast. That&#8217;s life. It happens and since we are the organized family, we prepare for the mishaps life throws our way. We may not know what they will be, but we prepare.

I recently learned that [Seth Godin](http://www.sethgodin.com/sg/) has scheduled out an entire year of blog posts. We are not nearly that organized or prepared, but we certainly hope to have a couple months worth of episodes by the time we launch.

It looks good and you can see a copy of it here in this post. Let us know what you think in the comments. That way it will give us time to make adjustments to before we actually go live with the podcast. We wanted to tie the site together with the podcast and so the album art should have a very familiar family silhouette to what you see here on the site.
