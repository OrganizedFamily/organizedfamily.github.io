The following list contains a list of tools, books, websites and internet resources which we find helpful and inspiring for our family.

## Finance

  * [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/)
  * [Financial Peace University](http://www.daveramsey.com/fpu) is a great course and can really help a family get on the right track. We recommend the class (not the online or the home study) and not just because it&#8217;s the least expensive course. There is just something powerful that comes from personal interaction with other people.

## Time Savers

  * Try [Audible](http://www.audible.com/) and [get two free books](http://www.amazon.com/Audible-Free-Trial-Digital-Membership/dp/B00NB86OYE/?ref_=assoc_tag_ph_1422899139880&_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=pf4&tag=digitalbias-20&linkId=W55TCNYK4KW7KYK4). Dave&#8217;s been listening to audible for years and loves it. His first audible book was [Getting Things Done](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OH7C0DW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00OH7C0DW&linkCode=as2&tag=digitalbias-20&linkId=Z4IPXGK7MF2POKM7). Of course you can also get the book on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143126563/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0143126563&linkCode=as2&tag=digitalbias-20&linkId=UXPHXTPRJV3SVFY6).

## Books

Dave reads a lot of books. Either via [Audible](http://www.audible.com/), on the [Kindle](http://www.amazon.com/associates/AppDownload/?ref_=assoc_tag_ph_1402131685749&_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=pf4&program=1&tag=digitalbias-20&linkId=7MZS2NK56NTTFIEA) or &#8220;Dead Tree&#8221; versions. You can see Dave&#8217;s reviews and ratings of books on Goodreads. Below are some of the books we recommend for organized families.

  * The 7 Habits of Happy Kids (much more on our level than the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, though that&#8217;s good too)
